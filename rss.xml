<newsitem headline="The Transition?">
<text>Sapphire Launcher has been in development for 2 years and continuing. Questions have been asked will we ever see a sequel to Sapphire Launcher? A rebase? With the development of Sapphyx Launcher, it will divide the user base in 2 groups. A premium group and fremium group. Sapphyx will be more original with bare minimum android libs used and Sapphire Launcher being a group project. Sapphire Launcher uses deprecated code from launcher 3 base tree providing users a compat usage between android 5 and beyond. With a possible suggested sequel with rebased code as a seperate package. Reasons for a seperate package is the updated code cant handle older methods of customization, the same features but different methods. This would provide an upgrade to returning users. Sapphyx Launcher is more of a private project testing my ability to perform providing me funds to continue my work. In order for me to continue to serve the community, time must be invested this year as my life becomes more busy with work and family. </text>

<newsitem headline="Nx Certificates">
<text>The Sapphire Launcher license keys will be updated soon to be universal keys for future projects. They will also be renamed Nx certificates based on their class. This will not affect Sapphire Launcher users in any way but will affect any users who simply installed the APKs without purchasing them. A licensed verification will be made and I will be notified of who isn't using a verified key. This will be logged in the Google dev console. Your device will be logged simply, nothing more unless you have a past history of purchases with me or returns. </text>
